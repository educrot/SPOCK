#(Note that .01=c .02=d .03=b),,,,,
#.01=c is expected 30 min early compared to TESS transit finder,#Duration 1.66h,,,,
#.02=d is expected 25-30 min late compared to TESS transit finder,#Duration 2.23h,,,,
#.03=b is expected 15-20 min late compared to TESS transit finder,#Duration 1.41h,,,,
#Constraints: Avoid elevation below 25 deg; avoid bright moon closer than 70 deg; at least 50% transit coverage,,,,,
#The next good transits I can see are:,,,,,
#Priority 1=highest; 3=lowest,,,,,
