**SPOCK** (Speculoos Observatory SChedule maKer) is a python package developed to handle the
planification of observation of the SPECULOOS telescopes. The project SPECULOOS -Search for habitable Planets EClipsing ULtra-cOOl Stars â€“
searches for potentially habitable exoplanets around the smallest and coolest stars
of the solar neighborhood `Link to site <https://www.speculoos.uliege.be/cms/c_4259452/fr/speculoos>`_.

*SPOCK* allows you to schedule SPECULOOS core program targets on several criteria:

*  Visibility of the target

*  Priority (calculated from stellar parameters)

*  Number of hours already performed

*  Coordination between different site

as well as external program targets (planetary candidates, eclipsing binaries, complex rotators, etc)
